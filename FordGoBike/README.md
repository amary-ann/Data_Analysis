## Dataset

> The Ford GoBike system dataset provides timestamped data about the start and end times for a bike,as well as the station names and locations, the user type (subscriber or casual rider), and some other features like the gender of the users and the bike sharing.
It included 183412 rows and 16 columns of which I performed some cleaning on which includes converting the wrong datatypes of some features and the dropping the null values in the dataset. I also removed some features that i didn't need to reduce the ambiguity of the dataset for my analysis and created some features from the data for a clearer definition. This brought the data to 
174952 rows and 11 columns.

## Summary of Findings

> From the Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Visualizations, these are the findings I acquired
- The service was used mostly during the week especially on Thurdays. While the weekends had fewer trips taken.
- Most bike rides are taken at 8am and 9am in the morning while in the evenings they are frequently taken between 4pm to 6pm. These are usually working hours.
- On weekdays there are most frequent trips at 5pm and 6pm but on Saturdays more trips are taken by 1pm and 2pm and on Sundays more trips are taken by 1pm and 4pm.
- There are more subscribers than customers patronizing this service.
- Males make use of this service the most followed by females than users of other genders
- Users of other genders take longer trips than the male and the female users
-It is observed that the total average duration of trips per day lies at 500 seconds(8 minutes). Also, users take longer rides during the weekend compared to weekdays.
- Customers take longer trips in general than subscribers. However, subscribers without bike sharing take longer trips than those without.
- Subscribers take more trips than customers for each day of the week.
-Bike sharing is only available to subscribers and even though a large portion of subscribers don't have bike sharing priviledge, they take more trips than customers.
- Customers take their longest trips during the early morning hours.
- Users without access to bike sharing take longer trips during the weekends
- The duration of user rides each hour are within close range.However, on Mondays and Fridays there is a significance between the customer and subscriber duration and there are some hours where some customers didn't take trips at all.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For my presentation, I will highlight the difference in the usage of bike service for customers and subscribers. I will introduce other features to see how the influence my results. The aim is to notice the difference between the cutomers and subscribers in patronizing this service.
