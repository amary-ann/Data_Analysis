# Data_Analysis
This repository includes a variety of data analysis projects I have completed. Each project demonstrates various stages of the analysis process, including data wrangling, assessment, cleaning, exploratory analysis, explanatory analysis, and data visualization. The goal is to highlight various aspects of data analysis and exhibit a deep understanding of certain concepts.
